<li>2. Bootstrap CSS and Javascript</li>
<li>3. Font Awesome (If you don't want the social buttons, then you don't need)</li>

</ul>

Check your html where you want to add this contact form. You might have already added some of these (or all of these) already. Copy the missing file links from index.html and add to your file. Do not forget to copy the custom styles from also.
<br>
Check around the ending body tag for JavaScripts. You must need to add these. Otherwise the form will not work.
<br>
Now copy the html codes of the form. Check the comment "Start copy" and "End copy". Copy the html codes between those comments and paste whereever you want to use the form.
<br>
You need to edit the mail.php file inside the mail folder to add your email address where you want to receive the email from the contact form. Don't worry, you don't need any php knowledge. It's simple. Just find "To Email" and add your email address and save it. Thats it.
<br>
upload the mail folder or the mail.php in your server/hosting. change the url in the Javascript code (you will find it bellow the comment "set the url of the php file that handle email processing").
<br>
That's all. The form should work fine. If anything wrong, check the steps again and find what you've missed. Still problem? comment here. I will reply.
